SourcePirates is a simple Multiplayer Online or Singleplayer game for learning Programming Languages the funny way.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See "Electron-Packager Executable" for notes on how to compile your own executable.

### Prerequisites

You need Node JS installed to run the SourcePirates game.

[NodeJS - Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

## Start Coding

If you want to create your own Ship script there are some code wrappers for different programming Languages in another Git Repository.
At the Moment we have the following QuickStart wrappers.  

* [PHP_Wrapper](https://github.com/rushpuppych/GitPirates_Setup/tree/master/PHP)
* CPP_Wrapper - Coming soon
* Java_Wrapper - Coming soon

## Built With

* [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) - Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/) - OpenSource Game Resources.
* [KennyAssets](https://kenney.nl/assets) - Game Assets (to buy and sometimes free to use under CC License)
